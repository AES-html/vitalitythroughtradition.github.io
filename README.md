Hello everyone!

  This is the official website of the UNC-Chapel Hill Vitality Through Tradition Club.

  We do bodyweight workouts, volunteer, socialize, and generally enjoy ourselves while staying healthy.

  The website itself isn't very complicated, its mostly just div boxes and other normal CSS elements. Picnic CSS was used to make the photo carousel and CSS scan helped make the box shadows.

  This code was made by me, but feel free to use it if you see something you like!

  Have a great day!
